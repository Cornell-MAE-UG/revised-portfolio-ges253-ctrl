## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/christmas-pfp.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}. As a design lead for my current project team, Cornell Steel Bridge, I have built a great familiarity with 3D CAD software such as Fusion 360 and Solidworks. In addition, I have increasingly familiarized myself with FEA software such as STAAD.Pro. In fact, one of my main goals for this year has been to work on a section-properties optimizer and trussing density optimizer with my fellow design leads. At Cornell Steel Bridge, we manufacture and weld all of our components in-house, and thus receive machining and welding training. Learning how to design with such welding and machining constraints in mind has been one of the most valuable parts of my journey.
