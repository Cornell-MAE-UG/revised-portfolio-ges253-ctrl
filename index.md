## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am an aspiring mechanical engineer attending Cornell University. I was born in Toronto, Canada, and grew up in Westchester, New York. I have developed my engineering skills through classes and extracurriculars. In particular, my student-run project team, CUAir, has aided me in fostering strong problem-solving and organizational habits in the realm of engineering production and testing.

Aside from engineering, I enjoy learning about the spanish language, and plan to receive a minor in the study. I also grew up skiing every weekend in the winters, and am now involved in the executive board of the Cornell Ski Club as the events and development coordinator. Besides that, some of my other hobbies include playing chess, listening to music, working out, and playing with my dog.
