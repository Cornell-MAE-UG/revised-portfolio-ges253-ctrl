## Project Placeholder

This is a placeholder project file created so you have a shell to fill in later.

When you're ready to publish the project, edit this file and:

- Update `title`, `description`, `technologies` and `image` as needed.
- Replace this `Project Placeholder` section with your project writeup and assets.
- Set `published: true` in the front matter to make the project visible on the site.

### How to update locally

Edit the file in `_projects/2025-project-shell.md`, then run:

```
git add _projects/2025-project-shell.md
git commit -m "Add project shell: Project Shell"
git push origin main
```

If you add images, put them in `assets/images/` and stage & commit them too.

Enjoy — replace this content with your project when it's ready.
