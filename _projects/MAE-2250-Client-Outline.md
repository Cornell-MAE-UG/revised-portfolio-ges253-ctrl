# Spotted Lanternfly Presence During Mechanical Harvesting

**Team:** Tree of Hell. **Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension/E&J Gallo Winery/National Grape

## Problem statement:

Currently for growers in upstate NY during the harvest process of vineyards, **Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) presence in grapes during the mechanical harvesting process** is contaminating the product. Trivial solutions are ineffective due to harvested grapes being partially liquified during collection and high quality standards of product. 

## Impact:
We address the problem at a single point in the harvest process. The single modular attachment lowers cost and enables more efficient harvest by minimizing wasted and dumped product. 

## Proposed direction:
During the harvest process before collection, separate juice from the grape-bug mixture, then separate bugs from grapes. Then, combine the grapes and juice once again in the collection. 

### Primary Concept:
**What it is:** Pressurized water tunnel to separate grapes and SLFs. Can use water pressure (Figure 1) or centrifugal force (Figure 2). Filter juice, then filter SLFs, then remix juice/grapes.

**How it would be used:** Apparatus placed in-line between harvester and collection systems.

**Why it’s better than the status quo:** Prevents any SLFs from entering the final harvest collection and saves any excess or needed grape juice for product production.

**End-of-semester proof-of-concept:**
Prototype of water tunnel with filters. Grapes flow through and SLFs are successfully separated.

## Key risks / unknowns:
- Altering safety/functionality of the harvesters - We will research rules and regulations for harvesters, and create a modular design that fits without interfering with the harvester.
- Buildup of grapes during filtration process - We’ll ensure the prototype can manage the upper limit of the harvester’s collection rate and/or have a staging area so that it meets that standard.
- Growers are not willing or able to install our design. We will ensure grower feedback is incorporated and maximize user-friendliness by testing ease of use with strangers.

## Questions for the client:
1. **Precisely when and where are grapes partially liquified during the harvest process?**  
   We need to know when liquid is present and the state of the grapes in the grape mixture throughout the harvest to determine the best way to filter SLF out.
2. **Which harvesters (models) and designs are frequently used in upstate NY?**  
    We need to know harvester designs to decide where in the process to insert our product. Is harvesting and containing done by two different vehicles or trailers, or by one unit?
3. **How willing and able are farmers to implement new technology in harvest?**
     Rank the importance of efficiency, reliability, repairability, durability, and ease of use for the end user (1 through 5). Add any other attributes deemed critical for grower-friendly design.
