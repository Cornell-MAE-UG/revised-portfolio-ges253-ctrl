## Project Placeholder — Thermodynamics Device

This is a template file created from the `2025-detailed-mechanism-optimization` project so you can fill in your thermodynamics project later.

Replace the sections below with your project content and assets. When ready, set `published: true` in the front matter to show the project on your site.

### How to structure this page

- **Title, description, technologies, and image** should all be set in the front matter above.
- Use `##` headings for sections such as "Project Description", "Design Approach", "Results", and "Lessons Learned".
- Add images in `assets/images/` and reference them like:

```
![Main view](/assets/images/thermodynamics-device-1.jpg)
```

### Example content to replace

## Project Description

Write a short paragraph describing your thermodynamics device: goal, constraints, and the main result.

## Approach

Summarize your modelling, experiments, or fabrication steps. Add references to data, figures, and external links.

## Results

Include measured performance, relevant plots, and short conclusions.

### Publish locally and push

When you've added content and images, run:

```bash
git add _projects/2025-thermodynamics-device.md assets/images/thermodynamics-device-*.jpg
git commit -m "Add project: Thermodynamics Device (draft)"
git push origin main
```

If you prefer a PR workflow, create a branch instead of committing to `main` and open a pull request on GitHub.

Enjoy — edit this file and replace the placeholder text with your final project content.
